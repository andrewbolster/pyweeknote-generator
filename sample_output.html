     <a href="https://jira.farsetlabs.org.uk/browse/FAC-88" title="Request change to door furniture to fix the current issue where the door handle on the front door gets loose and eventually breaks because of the force put on it when people open that door.  The current handle (recently replaced) is already obviously loose because of the same issue.

Given that the door handle does not need to turn in order to open/close the door, I would ask that a simple static bar or knob is installed to pull/push the door open/closed that would be much more solid and less prone to breakage.  This may require cursory permission from Weavers Court given that it's door furniture.">
